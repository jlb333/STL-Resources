# STL-Resources

Coming from a Social Work background, I wanted to create a website where indidvuals can search for St. Louis resources to help individuals 
in need.  The goal is to have a responsive website that displays results from the "Start Here" St. Louis Area Resource Directory, which is a 
PDF of resources gathered by Heartland Zen (a non-profit 501c3 organziation).  Users can also leave reviews and other helpful information for others that are looking at accessing the same resource.  

Technologies used in this project include:
-Java
-Spring Boot
-Spring Security
-Thymeleaf
-MySQL
-Bootstrap
